# MazeMaestro-Conducting-the-Perfect-Path-to-the-Goal
MazeMaestro is a Pygame-based simulator for visualizing pathfinding algorithms like A*, BFS, and DFS. Users can interact with a grid to set start/end points and create obstacles. The app provides real-time visual feedback on algorithm execution, making it an educational tool for understanding pathfinding concepts. Contributions are welcome!
