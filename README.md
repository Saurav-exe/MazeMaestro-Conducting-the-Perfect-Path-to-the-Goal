##Introduction
---------------
MazeMaestro is a interactive tool for visualizing and understanding pathfinding algorithms. It allows users to create a grid-based maze, set start and end points, and create obstacles. The app then uses the selected algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and end points.

##Features
------------
Support for A*, BFS, and DFS algorithms
Interactive grid-based maze with adjustable size
User-friendly interface for setting start and end points, as well as creating obstacles
Real-time visual feedback on algorithm execution

##Getting Started
-----------------
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/MazeMaestro.git
Install dependencies: pip install pygame
Run the application: python main.py

##Usage
------------
Create a grid-based maze by clicking on the grid cells.
Set the start point by clicking on a cell and selecting "Start".
Set the end point by clicking on a cell and selecting "End".
Create obstacles by clicking on cells and selecting "Obstacle".
Select an algorithm from the menu and click "Run" to start the simulation.
